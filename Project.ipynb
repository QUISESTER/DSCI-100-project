    "\n",
    "This project follows the full data science process described in *Data Science: A First Introduction* (Chapters 1–11). The analysis is based on data from a Minecraft research server hosted by UBC's Computer Science department.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers are interested in understanding which types of players are more likely to subscribe to a game-related newsletter. By identifying such predictors, they can better allocate resources and improve recruitment strategies.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Can we predict whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter using demographic and behavioral features recorded in `players.csv`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **binary classification problem**. We will:\n",
    "- Explore relevant predictors such as `experience`, `played_hours`, `gender`, and `age`\n",
    "- Fit a logistic regression model\n",
    "- Evaluate results using summary statistics and hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We also explore `sessions.csv` to better understand player engagement patterns, but the modeling will use only `players.csv`.\n",
